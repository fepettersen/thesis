\section{Properties of the model}



\section{Future work}
The developed model shows clear signs of being a first approach to the problem, and is in some ways a bit simple. 
Several improvements can be suggested to create a more realistic model both with respect to the diffusion processes on both length scales, and when it comes to the combination of the two models. 
This section will mention some of the improvements that can be done.

\subsection{PDE solver}
Although there is a well expressed limitation to the accuracy of the model determined by the stochastic term, an interesting extension to the software will be to introduce a finite element PDE Solver. 
Depending on which solver is implemented, this step will ensure that more complex (and realistic) properties of a diffusion process like nonlinearity can be introduced with relative simplicity. 
Another question is how this can be implemented in the lower-scale model..\\
A finite element solver will also, as discussed in section \ref{geometry}, vastly simplify the implementation of more realistic mesh geometries in more than 1D. \\
Experimenting with time derivative approximations that are better than first order could also be interesting seeing as a second order convergence was achieved by the similar model described in section \ref{simplified_test}. 
The actual benefit of introducing a better approximation to the time derivative must of course be tested.
