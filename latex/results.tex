\section{Validity of the model}
The results of the testing done in the Analysis-chapter, particularly the convergence tests based on varying the conversion-factor, Hc, to exceed the expected numerical error arising from the scheme itself based on equation \ref{}, suggest that the implementation of our model is correct. 
The mathematics overlap, as we have seen in chapter \ref{}, and if we introduce enough walkers there seems to be no difference between adding an area on the mesh where random walks solve the equation, and not doing so. 
In other words, our model converges to the continuum model in the limit of sufficient walkers.
