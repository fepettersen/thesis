\section{Validity of the model}
As we saw in the introduction to the analysis chapter it is possible to introduce enough walkers so that there is no mathematical difference between the combined model and the PDE-model. 
For all practical purposes, however we will not use that many walkers, because it is not the reason we introduced them in the first place. 
The simulations done in the analysis-chapter are largely done for verification purposes (see chapter \ref{debugging} in the appendix).
In other words, our model converges to the continuum model in the limit of sufficient walkers.

% The results of the testing done in the Analysis-chapter, particularly the convergence tests based on varying the conversion-factor, Hc, to exceed the expected numerical error arising from the scheme itself based on equation \ref{}, suggest that the implementation of our model is correct. 
% The mathematics overlap, as we have seen in chapter \ref{}, and if we introduce enough walkers there seems to be no difference between adding an area on the mesh where random walks solve the equation, and not doing so. 

\section{Diffusion times into spines}

Craske et.al. suggest that the neck of spines act as diffusion barriers which slow down, but don't complete
