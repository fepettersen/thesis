The following chapter is included to show that the developed hybrid diffusion solver can be applied to real life problems with only minor modifications.

\section{Physical scope}



\section{Implementation}

The developed computer code has been slightly modified in order to support modeling of dendrites and dendritic spines. 
First of all special dendritic spine objects have been developed. 
These are RW solvers with a funnel like geometry and some extra length parameters added. \\
The second modification is to the class responsible for combining the PDE and RW solvers. 
Since dendritic spines are placed on the boundary of a dendrite there is only surface overlap between the two length scales which eliminates the need for redistribution of walkers at each time step is eliminated.
